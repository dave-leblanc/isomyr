Examples
--------

In the top-level source directory for Isomyr, there is an examples directory.
This contains the following:

* The original example from Isotope, ported to work with Isomyr. This is a
  two-room world where a player can pick up two objects and jump on a bed.

* A new open ground example with 14 "rooms" that represent an outside
  environment.  This example simply shows moving between many connected and
  unwalled scenes.

Examining each of the Python files in the example directories is the best way
to get a sense of how to use Isomyr to create a game.

The examples may be run from the top-level source directory, for example::

  $ python examples/TwoRooms/tworooms.py

You may navigate the player with the arrow keys, <SPACE> for jump, and <ENTER>
for use.
