       A Python Isometric Game Engine



============
Introduction
============

i-so-myr: (n) Any of one or more scenes with the same measurements in
foreground and background, that have different properties and can exist in any
of several game worlds for a measurable period of time.

Isomyr is an isometric game engine based on Pygame, and written in Python. A
fork of the Isotope game engine, it provides the framework for constructing an
isometric graphics game with actors who can pick up and drop objects, jump onto
plaforms, and move about in projected 3d isometric environments.


========
Features
========

* Actors: used for player and monster game objects. Capable of facing, gravity,
  collision response, jumping, automation and inventory.

* Multiframe animation and images.

* Simple physics simulation of velocity, collision and touch detection.

* All objects can be customised and extended using Python.
